# Javascript-Canvas-Projects
Welcome to my JavaScript Canvas Projects repository! This collection features advanced projects leveraging the power of HTML5 Canvas, offering practical effects, image manipulation, and HTML text manipulation. The projects are built using object-oriented programming principles, providing a structured and modular codebase for easier understanding and extension.

## Features
Practical Effects: Explore a variety of practical effects such as particle systems, physics simulations, animations, and more.

Image Manipulation: Experience the capability to manipulate images dynamically on the canvas, including filters, transformations, and blending modes.

HTML Text Manipulation: Dive into the world of dynamic text manipulation on the canvas, with features like text animations, effects, and interactivity.
Object-Oriented Codebase

Modular Design: Each project is structured with a modular design, enhancing readability and maintainability.

Encapsulation: Object-oriented principles such as encapsulation ensure that code is organized and reusable.

Inheritance and Polymorphism: Leveraging inheritance and polymorphism allows for building upon existing functionality and creating variations of objects.

## How to Use
Clone the repository to your local machine using git clone.
Navigate to the project directory you're interested in.
Explore the project's code to understand its structure and functionality.
Experiment with the code, customize it, or extend it to create your own canvas masterpieces.

## Note
The project files are structured such that as you move down it increase in difficulty and its based of one master canvas code base and the other canvas projects are different variants of it.
